/*
Monkey Business
A local zoo wants to keep track of how many pounds of food each of its three
monkeys eats each day during a typical week. Write a program that stores this
information in a twodimensional 3 × 7 array, where each row represents a different
monkey and each column represents a different day of the week. The program should
first have the user input the data for each monkey. Then it should create a report
that includes the following information:
	• Average amount of food eaten per day by the whole family of monkeys.
	• The least amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey.
	• The greatest amount of food eaten during the week by any one monkey.
		Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for pounds of food eaten.
