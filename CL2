/*The variables xp and yp have both been declared as pointers to integers, 
and have been assigned values. Write the code to exchange the two integers 
(so that after the swap xp still points at the same location, but it now 
contains the integer value originally contained in the location pointed to by y; 
and vice versa-- in other words, in this exercise you are swapping the integers, 
not the pointers). Declare any necessary variables.*/
